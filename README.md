# Sample Project

This project contains a workspace with several packages.
Each package is a bit different.
Some have only a library crate, some have only a binary crate,
some have both.

Here are a few useful commands:

```
# Build all the things
cargo build

# Build just one package
cargo build --package <NAME>

# Build just one binary
cargo build --bin <NAME>

# Test all the things
cargo test

# Test just one package
cargo test --package <NAME>

# Run a binary
cargo run --bin <NAME>

# Other useful commands
cargo check
cargo clean
cargo doc --open
cargo tree
cargo update
```
